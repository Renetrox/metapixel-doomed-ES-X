			<text>MS-DOS: Microsoft Disk Operating System. Microsoft DOS is an operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatibles during the 1980s. IBM licensed and re-released PC DOS 1.0 in 1981 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993.</text>
